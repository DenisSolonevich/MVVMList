# MVVMList
This is a demo app to show the usage of MVVM, Retrofit, Room, Dagger 2, RX, Lists with Filter, DiffUtils, and implemented lazy data update to Repository.

Notice:
As standard backend it was designed to work with https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/. It has nice values in comfort to use structure.
But on the moment of testing the backend doesn't work. For this reason configured "mockend.com", but it generate random unreadable data.
